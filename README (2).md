#### Assignment Type: In class and homework for 4/26 if not finished

### Note: This assignment requires an existing Retro React project setup. Please ensure you have a local development environment ready for your project.

## Objective
Enhance your Retro React Media assignment by introducing advanced features such as routing, detailed component views, and dynamic user interaction. This project aims to deepen your understanding of React's capabilities including routing, state management complexities, advanced event handling, and component communication.

## Application Features

### Routing and Detail Pages
- **Navigation Management**: Utilize React Router to manage navigation between different parts of the application.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Set up a route for each type of media (VHS, DVD, CD) and a home route. Each section for each media type should have more information for users to view

### Event Handling Enhancements
- **Interactive Cart Management**: Add a "Remove from Cart" button with an event handler in the MediaItem component to manage user interactions dynamically.

### Prop Drilling and Component Communication
- **Deeper Interaction**: Pass a "toggle favorite" function down multiple levels to allow marking items as favorite, demonstrating deeper component interaction and the use of props for component communication.

### Additional Components
- **Message Component**: Implement a feedback mechanism that alerts users when they add or remove items from their cart.

## Requirements

### Hooks
- **useState and useReducer**: Use state management hooks to manage complex states like the media items list and user interactions within the cart.

### State Management
- **Advanced State Handling**: Utilize advanced techniques in state management to handle states like the user's cart and favorite items.

### Events
- **Complex Event Handling**: Implement comprehensive event handling to manage interactions such as adding to cart, removing from cart, and toggling favorite status.

### Props
- **Prop Handling**: Use props to facilitate data and function passing between nested components, ensuring robust component communication.

### JSX
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Use JSX effectively to render UI components based on state and props, showcasing dynamic data handling.

### CSS Styling
- **Basic Styling**: Add basic CSS styling to your project to enhance the retro feel of your UI.
